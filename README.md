# gosfv

This is a reincarnication of my old application QTSfv. The sole purpose of this
was for me to learn a bit of golang.

The application itself is a small application that can verify hash checksums
from SFV files. The default checksum is CRC32 but has been extended to also
handle MD5, SHA1 and SHA256.
